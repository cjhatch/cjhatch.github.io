# About me

I am a passionate scientist, engineer, and bioinformatician with a strong focus on rare disease and oncology bioinformatics using next-generation sequencing. During my Ph.D. in the Hughes Lab I have utilized organ-on-a-chip models and patient data to unravel the intricate language of cellular communication. I am committed to advancing precision medicine by decoding cellular disruptions caused by diseases and contributing to transformative healthcare solutions.
