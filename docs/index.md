# About me

I am a passionate scientist, engineer, and bioinformatician working in the [Hughes Lab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/hugheslab/) within the Department of Biomedical Engineering at UC Irvine. 

My work focuses on leveraging next-generation sequencing to unravel the complex language of cellular communication that drives rare diseases and cancers. By coupling in vitro organ-on-a-chip models with patient data, I am decoding cellular disruptions and contributing to transformative healthcare solutions.
